**Comments:**
- iPads are slick, untouchable, doesn't mirror aesthetic of the video
- how should I display video? — monitors or projectors?
- exposing the innerworkings? wires, lag, glitch, would be cool
- garbage bag den doesn't provide same experience as shed — trash bags will always be trash bags
- individual projection or stacked monitors?
- set to different timeframes?
- some images could work very well as posters, thinking of images separately
- has a trailer narrative feel, almost comes off like trailer for a series/exhibition
- could stretch out and break apart individual parts/aestehtics? (multiple aesthetic treatments) — cyborgs, comics, glitchs
- lean into (could work as) video game (even though started as video game)
- in regards to the text overlaying (oh no, think I'm losing myself) part/maybe greater text in general? seen as the thing that got you there but maybe not needed? Could back up the text approach and let images take over at some point?
- bold and large text in video would look good as vinyl on wall
- explode out of video, stay true to the video, resist pressure to fill up the wall

**reflection and thoughts:**

Never put anything in a gallery before, worried about a lot of doing this stuff, not sure what I want to do... Something about the posters, vinyl, and projection appeals to me, but I don't know how to make those things happen? Not sure if I want to break up the video, even though I understand and argee with the multiple aesthetics comment. If I were to go through with that option I would want to include a lot more stuff as well, maybe? Like the idea of creating a glitching space that exploded out of the video, but no idea what that actually physically means to me right now.

***problems:***
- Not sure what I have access to
- Having hard time visualizing anything
- Not sure how to make some of the equipment work

**IDEAS**
- Nonfunctional Computer with exposed back playing video on pedastal
- Vinyl on walls
- Poster
- wall of projections (idk how?)
