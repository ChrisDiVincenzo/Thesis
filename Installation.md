**Comments:**
- iPads are slick, untouchable, doesn't mirror aesthetic of the video
- how should I display video?
- monitors or projectors?
- exposing the innerworkings? wires, lag, glitch
- garbage bag den doesn't provide same experience as shed
- trash bags will always be trash bags
- individual projection or stacked monitors?
- set to different timeframes?
- some images could work very well as posters, thinking of images separately
- trailer narrative feel
- stretch out and break apart individual parts/aestehtics? (multiple aesthetic treatments)
- Cyborg, comic, glitch
- trailer for series/exhibition
- turn into video game (even though was a video game)
- in regards to the text overlaying part/maybe greater text in general? seen as the thing that got you there but maybe not needed? Back up the text approach and let images take over?
- bold and large text in video would look good as vinyl on wall
- explode out of video, stay true to the video, resist pressure to fill up the wall
