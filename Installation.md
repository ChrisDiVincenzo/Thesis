## Details on install at MAASS Gallery (SUNY Purchase)

### 2/18 Crit:

**Comments:**
- iPads are slick, untouchable, doesn't mirror aesthetic of the video
- how should I display video? — monitors or projectors?
- exposing the innerworkings? wires, lag, glitch, would be cool
- garbage bag den doesn't provide same experience as shed — trash bags will always be trash bags
- individual projection or stacked monitors?
- set to different timeframes?
- some images could work very well as posters, thinking of images separately
- has a trailer narrative feel, almost comes off like trailer for a series/exhibition
- could stretch out and break apart individual parts/aestehtics? (multiple aesthetic treatments) — cyborgs, comics, glitchs
- lean into (could work as) video game (even though started as video game)
- in regards to the text overlaying (oh no, think I'm losing myself) part/maybe greater text in general? seen as the thing that got you there but maybe not needed? Could back up the text approach and let images take over at some point?
- bold and large text in video would look good as vinyl on wall
- explode out of video, stay true to the video, resist pressure to fill up the wall

**reflection and thoughts:**

Never put anything in a gallery before, worried about a lot of doing this stuff, not sure what I want to do... Something about the posters, vinyl, and projection appeals to me, but I don't know how to make those things happen? Not sure if I want to break up the video, even though I understand and argee with the multiple aesthetics comment. If I were to go through with that option I would want to include a lot more stuff as well, maybe? Like the idea of creating a glitching space that exploded out of the video, but no idea what that actually physically means to me right now.

***problems:***
- Not sure what I have access to
- Having hard time visualizing anything
- Not sure how to make some of the equipment work

**IDEAS**
- Nonfunctional Computer with exposed back playing video on pedastal
- Text Vinyl on walls, which text, education is my drug? 
- Poster?
- wall of projections (idk how?)
 - use other videos as well?
- what is the aesthetic?
- nothing feels just right, need to keep thinking!
- maybe the install needs to be a cyberzombie itself? - what does this mean? How can I create a cyberzombie and show this video?

***The _INSTALLLATION_ is a Cyber-Zombie!***
- a cyber-zombie exists in the real world but has no function in reality, their only function is to glitch cyberspace. In a way they exist more in cyberspace, or aleast their presence is greater there.
- a cyborg has been fully integrated with their technology, they are in control of their devices, they do not glitch, they exist and function simultaneously in cyberspace and reality
- an installation of this video might have to not be functional in reality, it might involve a fleshy creature blocking a projection, with a link to the video vinyled on the wall (where it is being projected)
- do I need to include the cyborg counterpart? my gut is saying not to
- do I explode out other things? do I project other videos?
- how do I create this fleshy object?????? - does it need to be real? feel like it kind of does... could dress up a mannequin to look like me, maybe add plush? put a bunch of pink clay on face
- second layer of projection with other videos
- project on garbage bags? - trash is kind of like nonfucntional 
- can i put vinyl on garbage bags?
- need to address this: "At this time we do not allow painting/using tapes on walls.", but they seem to allow nailing in??? could nail up garbage bags I guess, just seems extra
- feels like it is still missing something... should the creature be sitting?
- could try to recreate the room, and play on hard to see monitor in front of the creature, will need monitor, how do I play something on loop with that? maybe i could just dress up iPad to look like something else
- jail cell?
- simplify: maybe just creature sitting on stool watching projected video, aligned so that the viewer can't watch straight on without getting in the way, put a bunch of extra wires too... how do I make the projector loop? can I just plug a flashdrive in? creature should be plugged into projector
- make holes in head and project through head?
- is this enough? feels like it is missing something but can't place it... another object? On the wall or the ground? explode out, what should be there? cover the entire space in pixels... can't do that. should I project on something interesting? hang posters? Only way I know how to do that is with printouts...

[POSTER IDEAS](poster.md) — cancel poster idea, video stills

### 2/25 Meeting: Focus on Materiality

- playing with human and nonhuman materials/representations
- soil wires plastics 
- potted plants with wires
- sink? melted plastics in dirt? burn some stuff?
- uncomfortable clashing of materials
- consumption 
- don't do posters, focus on materials/materiality 
- be intentional, make a story and reason for very object placed
- could use stills to make another glitch video, could incorporate zoom video settings, unstable connection
- scraps of wood? screwed/clamped together weird, electrified
