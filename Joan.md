Agender, AFAB, BFRB, overweight, eldest child, ADD, depression, anxiety, Gemini Sun Virgo Moon Capricorn Rising, doesn’t shave anything but their head, likes folk music, student for life, not a lot of debt yet, no credit, spent almost 2 years in and out of separate section 8 housing, 6 years of higher education, cold hands ... 

Samie’s work engages the political importance of intimacy and minutia, their intersectional reality contrasted by the implications of a body and conditions they could never choose. They unpack the relationships and experiences that have developed as a result of this existence. A native New Yorker, with a family that’s lived in the United States for close to 100 years, her work explores dreams of housing equity, healthcare for all and systems of care that include unequivocally, every life on the planet, and those who will inhabit it once we are gone.

Project
Joan Johnson @itsmejoantoday
Here lies the introduction to my lifelong Twitter persona @itsmejoantoday. She is a drag persona of white womanhood that has allowed me to be more vulnerable within the space of the 
pandemic - where I have been working with the power of vulnerability we carry, in tandem with our general Queer loneliness and shared estrangement. The forms consist of social media, polaroid photography, photo albums and small interiors of passed along materials made into memory piles. Through this work I have moved into public spaces (ie. dancing at bus stops) in search for an audience to start conversations with centered in joy during a time of pain and 
uncertainty. The theatrical, entertaining nature of existing within and for a public that will not always be smiling is difficult but necessary - if not just for collective catharsis but for their hope, curiosity and need to engage.
