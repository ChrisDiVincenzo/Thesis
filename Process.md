The video game included in the video project places the user in their own education system. They must go through multiple maze puzzles and pick up floating keys that grant them skills. Some of the skills are negative, i.e. Depression, and clog the user's screen, making it harder to progress in the education system. If the user is able to acquire all 31 skills they are teleported to an office cubicle where they can no longer move.
