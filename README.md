**WATCH HERE:** [Learning is Fun](https://youtu.be/_1-43Bd7kPM)

This video is influenced by Critical Pedagogy texts and shows multiple versions of myself going through a banking system of education, which trains me to be a cyber zombie. A cyber zombie is a dehumanized creature who can no longer function in the “real” world. If they are to re-humanize, they will need external help. This video questions the capitalist education system, authenticity, individuality, progress, the function of art, and what it means to be human in the digital age.
